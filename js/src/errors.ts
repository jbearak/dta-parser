/**
 * What went wrong:
 * - `DTA_CORRUPT`: the file is damaged, not a .dta file, or no longer
 *   matches what was read from it before;
 * - `DTA_TOO_LARGE`: the file is fine, but a value or read does not fit
 *   in memory here;
 * - `DTA_IO`: reading the file or writing the output failed (the
 *   underlying error is the `cause`);
 * - `DTA_INVALID`: an argument is wrong, such as data that cannot be
 *   written or an unknown encoding;
 * - `DTA_OUT_OF_RANGE`: a variable or rows the file does not have
 *   (a `RangeError`);
 * - `DTA_CLOSED`: the reader was closed;
 * - `DTA_INTERNAL`: a bug in dta-parser.
